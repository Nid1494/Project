## Project Overview

This repository showcases various projects related to Chemical Engineering, including cement quality prediction, an inventory management system, and reaction yield prediction. In the "Installation" section, I've provided a general structure for installation instructions, along with placeholders for each project. You can fill in the specific installation steps for each project to guide users on how to set up and run them.

## Projects

### Cement Quality Prediction

#### Project Description

The Cement Quality Prediction project focuses on predicting the Blaine value, a crucial indicator of cement fineness. We developed a data-driven predictive model using Python and conducted comprehensive data analysis, including model fit checks, time series plots, and correlation analysis. The project aims to optimize cement production processes by improving accuracy and efficiency in predicting cement quality.

### Inventory Management System

#### Project Description

The Inventory Management System project is a Python-based solution for efficient inventory management. It includes features for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, optimizing data storage and retrieval. The system demonstrates effective problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

### Reaction Yield Prediction

#### Project Description

The Reaction Yield Prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict reaction yields based on input parameters. We utilized Python and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model development. This project showcases self-driven learning and the application of machine learning concepts.
